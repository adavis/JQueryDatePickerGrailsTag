A Grails custom tag that will render a JQuery UI DatePicker component and will bind that to a date field in your domain class when you hit submit on the form

What the jQuery DatePicker grails tag does:

    1. It creates three hidden input fields dateField_day, dateField_month, dateField_year.
    2. Itâ€™s responsible for populating these hidden input fields when a date has been selected from the calendar.
    3. Supports having multiple date fields in the same form without any conflict.
